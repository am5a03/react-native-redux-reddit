# Readme

- This is a toy project that trying to integrate [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) into react native

- Largely base on the [redux author's reddit example](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html)

- A very simple reddit client that fetching the 'funny' section, supporting infinite scrolling
- Not supporting iOS yet. :P
